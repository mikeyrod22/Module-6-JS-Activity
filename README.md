# Module-6-JS-Activity

This was my first introduction to Javascript. In the prework before my coding bootcamp began, we were provided a link to a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"> website containing info about Javascript.</a> We were then tasked with creating and manipulating a simple box using html and JS. 

Here is a link to the <a href="https://mikeyrod22.github.io/Module-6-JS-Activity/">deployed website.</a>
